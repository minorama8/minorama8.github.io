Using immersive storytelling, my Tudor farming Twine story examines the day in the life of a tudor farmer and the social effects during the period. Users make decisions that impact their daily routine through a branching format which improves its engagement. By being offered roles including the life of a farmer, cook, or carpenter, possibilities are endless within each subunit. In hopes to mimic the close reality during this time, the story includes real historical context about harvesting, brewing ale, managing supplies and more. Multimedia components, including, youtube videos, images, dropdowns, and fill-ins, enhance the personalization aspect of this story while showcasing my expertise in Twine, creativity production, and design. This project demonstrates my ability to create a captivating story whilst incorprating realism with multimedia storytelling.
